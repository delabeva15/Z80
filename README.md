# z80 & TIBASIC
An archive of z80 assembly projects I did on my ti83+ calculator. Most projects were lost due to transferring computers, but here are a few. To use these programs simply go to https://clrhome.org/asm/ and compile them into 8xp files. From there you can transfer the file to your ti83+ calculator using the TI connect application. *RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK*
assembly is very risky to run on an actual device if not tested thoroughly, if you use chemtech you can use a virtual version of your ti83+ calculator and run these programs there to risk any corruption.
AND CORRUPTION IS REAL!! I have bricked one of my calculators entirely after running bad code on it. These programs on here should be alright but have not been fully tested so again, run at your own risk if you choose to do so.

As for TIBASIC, feel free to run them! No corruption will occur, and that's a guarantee.
